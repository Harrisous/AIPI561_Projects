For example:\n\n* Do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g. vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free)?\n* Are you looking to cook something quick and easy, or do you have some time to spare?\n* Do you have any ingredients already at home that you'd like to use up?\n* Is there a specific cuisine or type of dish you're interested in making (e.g. Italian, Mexican, stir-fry)?\n* How many people are you planning to cook for?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of your preferences and needs, I can provide you with some personalized suggestions for what to get during your shopping trip!"
